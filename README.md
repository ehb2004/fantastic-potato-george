## User Story
As a runner, I wanted to be able to log my runs in order to track my progress over the course of months as I train for a half marathon!!

## Narrative
This running app is a revamped version of my original running log that I created for my first project in CIS-366. It's really come full circle.

Here is a quick look at my original web app ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

Now look at this code from to OG app! üôÉ
```
  <h2 id='runHeader'>RUNS</h2>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Jan 25</strong> 3.2 miles, 35m 0s</li>
    <li><strong>Jan 24</strong> 1.2 miles, 13m 48s</li>
    <li><strong>Jan 21</strong> 2.5 miles, 33m 32s</li>
    <li><strong>Jan 20</strong> 1 mile, 11m 0s</li>

  </ul> 
  ```
I drew a lot of inspiration from my favorite app, Strava. Take a look!
